# VehicleModel

The core element which references a `VehicleType` and a `VehicleEquipmentProfile`.

## Location
```
PublicationDelivery/dataObjects/ResourceFrame/vehicleModels
```

## Properties

### ID
A unique ID generated by the vehicle registry when creating a `VehicleModel`. Together with the version this can be used to uniquely identify a `VehicleModel` from the schedule data.

#### Example:
```xml
<VehicleModel id="321">
  ...
</VehicleModel>
```

### Version
The version of the `VehicleModel`. When querying a `VehicleModel` the ID and version must be supplied. This ensures that `VehicleModel`s can be updated without breaking other systems using it. A special operation to just query the most recent `VehicleModel` should also be available.

This version attribute must also be incremented if a referenced component like an `Equipment` or `VehicleType` changes.

#### Example:
```xml
<VehicleModel version="4">
  ...
</VehicleModel>
```

### Name
The common name or model designation of the `VehicleModel` (e.g., "Mercedes-Benz Citaro"). The name doesn't have to be unique. If a `VehicleModel` with the same name already exists, their differences should be explained in the description.

#### Example:
```xml
<Name>Vehicle Model Name</Name>
```

### Description
Detailed description of the `VehicleModel`, including special features or configurations.

#### Example:
```xml
<Description>Standard city bus with hybrid propulsion</Description>
```

### Manufacturer
The manufacturer that produced this `VehicleModel`.

#### Example:
```xml
<Manufacturer>Mercedes-Benz</Manufacturer>
```

### equipmentProfiles
Reference to a `VehicleEquipmentProfile` defining the available equipment.

#### Example:
```xml
<equipmentProfiles>
  <VehicleEquipmentProfileRef ref="id"/>
</equipmentProfiles>
```
### TransportTypeRef

Reference to a `VehicleType` defining further details of the `VehicleModel`.

```xml
<VehicleTypeRef ref="id"/>
```
