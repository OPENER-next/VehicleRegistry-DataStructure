# Vehicle Types

NeTEx separates train engines and carriages from other public transport vehicle types. They are modelled via specific `TractiveElementType` and `TrailingElementType` under a different location:

```
PublicationDelivery/dataObjects/ResourceFrame/trainElementTypes/TractiveElementType|TrailingElementType
```

However this distinction is not used in the registry data structure. Instead everything is based on `VehicleType` and further detailed via `TransportMode`. Carriages can be detected by checking the `SelfPropelled` property.

## Location

```
PublicationDelivery/dataObjects/ResourceFrame/vehicleTypes/VehicleType
```

## VehicleType

### ID
A unique ID generated by the vehicle registry when creating a vehicle type. Together with the version this can be used to uniquely identify a vehicle type data from the schedule data.

#### Example:
```xml
<VehicleType id="321">
  ...
</VehicleType>
```

### Version
The version of the vehicle type. When querying a vehicle type the ID and version must be supplied. This ensures that vehicle types can be updated without breaking other systems using it. A special operation to just query the most recent vehicle type should also be available.

This version attribute must also be incremented if a referenced component like an equipment or deck plan changes.

#### Example:
```xml
<VehicleType version="4">
  ...
</VehicleType>
```

### Name
The common name or model designation of the vehicle type (e.g., "Mercedes-Benz Citaro"). The name doesn't have to be unique. If a vehicle type with the same name already exists, their differences should be explained in the description.

#### Example:
```xml
<Name>Vehicle Model Name</Name>
```

### Description
Detailed information about the vehicle type, including special features or configurations.

#### Example:
```xml
<Description>Standard city bus with hybrid propulsion</Description>
```

### EuroClass
Euro emission standard classification (e.g., Euro 6).

#### Example:
```xml
<EuroClass>B</EuroClass>
```

### SelfPropelled
Indicates whether the vehicle has independent propulsion capability.

#### Example:
```xml
<SelfPropelled>true</SelfPropelled>
```

### PropulsionType
Propulsion technology(s) used by the vehicle. Multiple values must be separated by spaces.

#### Values (`PropulsionTypeEnumeration`):
```{.python .cb-run}
list_enum_values(
  '/netex_framework/netex_reusableComponents/netex_vehicleType_support.xsd',
  'PropulsionTypeEnumeration'
)
```

#### Example:
```xml
<PropulsionType>hybrid</PropulsionType>
```

### FuelType
Energy source(s) used by the vehicle. Multiple values must be separated by spaces.

#### Values (`FuelTypeEnumeration`):
```{.python .cb-run}
list_enum_values(
  '/netex_framework/netex_reusableComponents/netex_nm_equipmentEnergy_support.xsd',
  'FuelTypeEnumeration'
)
```

#### Example:
```xml
<FuelType>diesel battery</FuelType>
```

### MaximumRange
Maximum operational range in meters on full energy source.
System for units can be specified on frame. Default is metres as defined [here](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/xml/resource/units.xml).

#### Example:
```xml
<MaximumRange>240</MaximumRange>
```

### MaximumVelocity
Maximum design speed in m/s.
System for units can be specified on frame. Default is metres per second as defined [here](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/xml/resource/units.xml).

#### Example:
```xml
<MaximumVelocity>100</MaximumVelocity>
```

### TransportMode
Primary transport mode category according to NeTEx classification.

#### Values (`AllModesEnumeration`):
```{.python .cb-run}
list_enum_values(
  '/netex_framework/netex_reusableComponents/netex_mode_support.xsd',
  'AllModesEnumeration'
)
```

#### Example:
```xml
<TransportMode>bus</TransportMode>
```

### DeckPlanRef

A reference to the DeckPlan of this vehicle depicting the entrances, areas, seats and more.

#### DELFI

- 3010 ↦ Can be generated from the `DeckPlan` if detailed enough.

#### Example:
```xml
<DeckPlanRef ref="id"/>
```

### capacities
Container for passenger/vehicle capacity specifications.

- `PassengerVehicleCapacity`: Capacity for transporting other vehicles.
  - `VehicleCategory`
  - `VehicleCapacity`
- `PassengerCapacity`: Passenger capacity by fare class.
  - `TotalCapacity`: The maximum capacity the vehicle is allowed to carry. This is **not** necessarily equal to the sum of all sub capacities.
  - `SeatingCapacity`
  - `StandingCapacity`
  - `PrioritySeatingCapacity`: See [NeTEx Proposal](https://github.com/NeTEx-CEN/NeTEx/issues/898)
  - `WheelchairPlaceCapacity`
  - `PramPlaceCapacity`
  - `BicycleRackCapacity`: While it is technically possible to depict the bicycle capacity via `PassengerVehicleCapacity`, it should be done here, regardless of whether the space is a rack or not.

#### DELFI

- 3050 ↦ `PrioritySeatingCapacity > 0`

#### Example:
```xml
<capacities>
  <PassengerVehicleCapacity version="any" id="PassengerVehicleCapacity/id/1">
    <VehicleCategory>car</VehicleCategory>
    <VehicleCapacity>4</VehicleCapacity>
  </PassengerVehicleCapacity>

  <PassengerCapacity version="any" id="PassengerCapacity/id/1">
    <FareClass>firstClass</FareClass>
    <SeatingCapacity>8</SeatingCapacity>
  </PassengerCapacity>

  <PassengerCapacity version="any" id="PassengerCapacity/id/2">
    <FareClass>secondClass</FareClass>
    <TotalCapacity>220</TotalCapacity>
    <SeatingCapacity>207</SeatingCapacity>
    <StandingCapacity>275</StandingCapacity>
    <WheelchairPlaceCapacity>2</WheelchairPlaceCapacity>
    <PramPlaceCapacity>3</PramPlaceCapacity>
    <BicycleRackCapacity>33</BicycleRackCapacity>
    <PrioritySeatingCapacity>25</PrioritySeatingCapacity>
  </PassengerCapacity>
</capacities>
```

### Length
